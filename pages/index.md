<h6><code>Olá, Vida longa e próspera 🖖</code></h6>

I’m a curious maker based in [<span class="btn-[#1DC98A]">Goiânia, Brazil 🇧🇷</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goi%C3%A2nia).

☁︎☀️ **By day**, I architect and build games and game engines; breathe new life into vintage hardware with emulators; and push the boundaries of rendering with cutting-edge techniques.

🖤⃝🌕 **By night**, I solve math puzzles to keep my mind sharp; craft poetry in Brazilian Portuguese <span class="text-[0.65rem]">(and English?)</span>; lose myself in philosophy and thought experiments; curl up with my husband and family for games, chats, and laughter<sup>1</sup>; and watch anime, movies, and binge-worthy shows.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I’m on a mission to craft clear, welcoming blog posts and tutorials that keep knowledge open and free for all, empowering others to tackle complex topics with confidence.
